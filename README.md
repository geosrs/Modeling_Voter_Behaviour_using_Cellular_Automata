# Modeling Voter Behaviour Using Cellular Automata

The goal of this project is to study models which are able to capture voting behaviour and observe
the long term emergent behaviour of the entire voting system. This is a fairly complicated problem
to tackle. Thus, an incremental approach has been used. Since the
problem has elements which dynamically evolve with time cellular automaton
as the simulation technique has been chosen.
Initially, models based on simple rules and binary states(two-party model) have been developed which lead to models using more complicated rules and introducing variety in the states of the agents. The following real world scenarios have been implemented:
1. Effect of Mass Media
2. Effect of Radicals
3. Tri-party system
